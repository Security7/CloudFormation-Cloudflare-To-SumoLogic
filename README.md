# CloudFormation template for the Cloudflare to Sumo Logic project

This repo contains the main AWS Stack definition for the Cloudflare to SumoLogic project.

# Folder structure

The additional folder structure in this folder is for development purpose only. To help developers reason more easily about the stack. Since the CF file can grow very quickly to a size hard to manage and reason about. By having each section in a separated file and basic folder structure, it becomes much easier to manage. If this still confuses you, don't pay attention at the folders inside this repo, you need to work only with the `Cloudflare-to-SumoLogic.json` file.
